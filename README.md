In Silico Discovery of NDM-1 Metallo-β-Lactamase Inhibitors for Klebsiella pneumoniae

 Overview
Antimicrobial resistance represents a critical global health challenge. Among resistant pathogens, Klebsiella pneumoniae has emerged as a significant concern due to its ability to produce New Delhi Metallo-β-Lactamase (NDM-1), which hydrolyzes a wide range of β-lactam antibiotics.
This project applies in silico approaches to identify novel inhibitors of NDM-1 through molecular docking, ADMET profiling, and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations.


 Objectives
•	Retrieve and prepare the NDM-1 target protein (PDB: 6NY7)

•	Screen standard ligands and sulfonamide derivatives for inhibitory potential

•	Perform molecular docking studies using AutoDock Vina

•	Predict pharmacokinetic and toxicity profiles through ADMET analysis

•	Evaluate the dynamic stability of ligand–protein complexes using 100 ns MD simulations in GROMACS


 Methodology
•	Protein and Ligand Preparation

•	Target protein retrieved from the Protein Data Bank (PDB ID: 6NY7)

•	Standard ligands: Penicillin, Ampicillin, Benzyl Penicillin, Sulfonamide, Mercaptopurine, etc.

•	Sulfonamide derivative dataset (~4500 compounds) obtained from PubChem and filtered using Lipinski’s Rule of Five and Veber’s criteria


Molecular Docking
•	Protein preparation and docking conducted using AutoDock Vina via PyRx

•	Virtual screening yielded ~60 promising sulfonamide derivatives with strong binding affinities


ADMET Analysis
•	Tools: ADMETLab 2.0 and Protox-II

•	Evaluated Absorption, Distribution, Metabolism, Excretion, and Toxicity properties

•	Two lead candidates were identified:

•	(3Z)-N-hydroxypenta-1,3-diene-2-sulfonamide (PubChem CID: 118156306)

•	N-hydroxyfuran-2-sulfonamide (PubChem CID: 46175386)


Molecular Dynamics Simulations
•	Conducted using GROMACS 5.0.4 for 100 ns

•	Structural analyses performed: Root Mean Square Deviation (RMSD), Root Mean Square Fluctuation (RMSF), Radius of Gyration (Rg), and Solvent Accessible Surface Area (SASA)

•	Results confirmed the stability of the selected ligand–protein complexes

 Compound Name	PubChem CID	Docking Score (kcal/mol)	ADMET Profile	MD Stability
(3Z)-N-hydroxypenta-1,3-diene-2-sulfonamide	118156306	[-5.6]	Favorable	Stable
N-hydroxyfuran-2-sulfonamide	46175386	[-5.1]	Favorable	Stable
Sulfonamide (control)	–	[-5.2]	Moderate	Stable


Figures to include:
•	Representative docking poses

•	Interaction diagrams

•	RMSD, RMSF, Rg, and SASA plots

 Conclusion
This in silico study identified two sulfonamide derivatives—(3Z)-N-hydroxypenta-1,3-diene-2-sulfonamide and N-hydroxyfuran-2-sulfonamide—as promising inhibitors of NDM-1. Both compounds demonstrated strong binding affinities, favorable ADMET profiles, and stable interactions during MD simulations. These findings highlight their potential as lead compounds for the development of novel therapeutics against NDM-1–mediated resistance, pending experimental validation.
